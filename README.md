# PISS
### Python Image Selection Saver

Python Image Selection Saver is a program build with [PyQT5] that lets you sort out images you like of a collection in a quick way. It's goal is to save a lot of time when browsing collections of images, like having thousands of images from the smartphone, but dont want to swipe each one in the gallery. 

### Workflow
The main workflow goes as follows:

  - Open the path to the directory with the images you like to browse
  - Define a output directory
  - Navigate with the arrow keys
  - Press the space button to move the current image to the output

### Plans
  - In planning
